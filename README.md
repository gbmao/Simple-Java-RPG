🗡️ Simple Java RPG

A simple console-based RPG built to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java — featuring exploration, battles, and inventory management.

🎯 Goal

This project was created to reinforce my understanding of core Java concepts such as:

Classes and objects

Inheritance and polymorphism

Encapsulation and abstraction

Exception handling and clean code design

⚙️ Features

✅ Explore interconnected rooms, each with unique descriptions
⚔️ Battle simple enemies in turn-based combat
🎒 Manage an inventory with usable items (like potions)
❤️ Track player stats — health, damage, experience, and level
🔄 Progress through rooms and encounters dynamically

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gbmao/Simple-Java-RPG
```

Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse).

Run the Game class to start playing.
